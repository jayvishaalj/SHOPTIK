# SHOPTIK :shopping_cart: :shopping_cart: 

### What we do
Shoptik is a shopping slot ticketing platform that allows users to buy tickets for shops to ensure social distancing during their trips for essentials. It also enables tracking of a carrier.

:computer: :computer: The project was developed as part of the [Chain Runner Hackathon](https://chainrunner.devfolio.co)

### Salient Features
#### As a customer, you can:
* Know availability of shops and stock in advance and book them.
* Get a QR code mailed to you after booking.
* Come to shop in the slot that you booked :shopping_cart: :shopping_cart:
* Get booking history.
* Report a shop, in case social distanding rules arent maintained. 


#### As a shopkeeper, you can:
* Shop/Update stock information.
* Verify a QR, using an app exclusively built for you.
* Make sure to sanitize the shop after every slot :smile: :smile: 

#### As an admin, you can:
* Get the history of all shops a user has been to.
* Mark a particular person as carrier and immediately get information about all people the carrier has ever been in contact with. 
* Bring down the spread with ease :rocket: :rocket: 

### Like you, your data is safe. :lock:
We have used blockchain tehcnology to ensure anonymity between shops as well as users. Further, since location info is key, we have made sure it cannot be changed. :closed_lock_with_key: 


Shoptik believes in ensuring customersâ€™ safety and health during their trips to buy essentials, removing the risk of communicating any diseases while outside by regulating crowd movement. An easy and efficient way to control panic hoarding and overcrowding.
